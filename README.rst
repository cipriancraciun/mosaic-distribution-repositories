How to build
============

**It should be built** from the ``mosaic-distribution`` repository, as it depends on a proper set workbench and symlinks to other
repositories...

Exceptions: ::

    This notice applies only on the current "repository" and does not transcend
    to the other folders matching a pattern like "<<product>>"
    (all clearly enumerated inside the file "bundles.txt" in the first column,
    together with the original source in the second column).
    
    Thus this repository serves the sole purpose of a "cache" for those software
    bundles, and it shouldn't be seen as a redistribution source for them.
    Therefore it is made public just as a convenience for those building the
    mOSAIC sotfware artifacts directly from source code.
